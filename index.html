		<p>Hello my name is Cecilio Alejandro Ramirez Cordova, but you can call me alex for short. I am 22 years old adn i live in Marin County California. I am a student at College of Marin and I am also a student of the UC Berkeley Extension where i am taking a coding bootcamp so that i can become a full stack web developer.</p> 

		<P>Aside from being a student and learning how to code I enjoy spending my time with my 2 dogs Oddi and Zola. Oddi is a little dog he's around 30 pounds and he is a mix of many dogs the only one that i can guess from him is that he is a chihuahau. Zola is the newest member to my family and she is 4 month old Rotweiler mixed with a German Shepard. </p>
